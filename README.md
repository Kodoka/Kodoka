Howdy! I'm Chance Cruz, or Lucky, or Kodoka. I prefer Kodoka, but it doesn't particularly matter. I'm just a space between the stars.

About a year ago I decided it was time to become a howdy fella. The ease with which I say "Howdy" might imply I've been a howdy fella
my whole life, but it's a rather recent thing. Don't let that intimidate you, though. I'm just like y'all, except I say howdy, and
y'all. It just feels right, y'know?

Anyway, the stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Only a fool would take anything posted
here as fact. Or, as my grandpa used to say, and is engraved upon his gravestone, "A story not embelished is a story not worth
telling." See how easy it is for me to lie to you? That's not even what's engraved upon his gravestone. With that in mind, here is my
story.

I was born in 1989. Yes, I'm rather old. It takes time, y'know? Born in 1989, I was, in Cholula, Mexico. I don't really remember much
of my childhood there. Really, the only thing I remember about my childhood in Cholula was riding my little bicicleta. One of those
old big wheel toys. It was an overcast day. My father didn't want it to rain on me, so he ripped a hole in black trash bag, and sent
me on my way. It began drizzling, and between the bald tires of the big wheel, and the slick sidewalk, I was unable to make any real
progress towards home. Eventually it began to thunder, and being logically fearfull that I'd be struck by lightning, I began to panick.
That's where my memory concludes. Me frantically pedalling, tears in my eyes, the scrape of the plastic tires slipping on concrete,
and thunder echoing off every hard surface.
